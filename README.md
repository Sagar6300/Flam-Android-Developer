# Flam-Android-Developer_Set_1


This repository contains solutions to different coding questions and a simple Android app project.  
Each folder contains a separate question with its own **README.md** file explaining the logic and details of the solution.  

## Repository Structure

- `Question_1` - Solution for **LRU Cache** in C++
- `Question_2` - Solution for **MyHashMap** implementation in C++
- `Question_3(BookReviewApp)` - A simple **Book Review App** built for Android using Java (MVVM architecture).

## How to Read

Each question folder has its own **README.md** file.  
You can navigate into the folder and read the README to understand how the solution works.

For example:
- `Question_1/README.md` → LRU Cache explanation
- `Question_2/README.md` → MyHashMap explanation
- `Question_3/README.md` → Book Review App details

This way, each question is self-contained and has its own README explaining the logic and details of the code.
